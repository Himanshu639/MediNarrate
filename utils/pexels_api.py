    # For that thing, I am going to implement a logic(code) that will trim the longest video(starting and ending [assuming starting and ending isn't important]) in the list of videos to fit the last video of 6 seconds.

    # -> According to me, if we take 6 seconds from exactly in the middle ([mid-3.....mid.....mid+3] => makes 6 seconds) that would be a great choice because it will the most valueable content (again, assuming starting and ending isn't important)
